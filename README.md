# LoL Config Manager

- You can manage your configs
- Save them to the folder and replace whenever you want
- Save path of configs unfortunately you cant change, but its actually brilliant. If you will lose this script, everything is in config folder (\League of Legends\Config\Saved CFGs) and you can change configs manually.

# How does that actually works?
- First of all you need to log in your LoL account in Client

 EVERY LOL ACCOUNT HAS HIS OWN CONFIG
 
- After login you can manage your CFGs
